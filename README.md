SiON
====
The SiON (pronounced as “scion”) is a software synthesizer library. It was originally written in AS3. This fork is a conversion to Haxe.

SiON provides simple sound synchronization with DisplayObject and an easy dynamic sound generation. You can generate various sounds without any mp3 files or wave data. The musical sequence is represented as Music Macro Language (a simple text data) or standard MIDI Files. It allows your final distribution to be very small.
