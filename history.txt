0.0.2-alpha Feb. 1, 2015
------------------------
Fixed parsing of user commands, including 30 or so internal commands implemented as user commands.
Fixed parsing of sequences that don't start with a note.
Tested fader and low pass filter.
Fixed lots of places where as3hx left "break" statements in a default case, causing the outside loop to exit.

0.0.1-alpha Jan. 5, 2015
------------------------
First public release
Trivial examples work
Setting voices to the internal synthesizer instruments works.
Android support does *not* work well, I think due to audio driver issues in lime.
iOS support is untested.
